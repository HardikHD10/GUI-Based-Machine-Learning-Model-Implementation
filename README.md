## Vehicle Classification

A GUI based application that classifies different types of vehicles. The main script for this is `app.py`.

## Image Captioning

A model that generates captions for given images. It comes with a user-friendly GUI for easy interaction. The primary script is `app.py`.

## Dog Classification

This is a classification model that identifies different breeds or types of dogs. Check out `dog_breed.py` for the main implementation.

## Setup and Usage

1. Navigate to the desired directory.
2. Install the necessary dependencies (usually mentioned in a requirements file or at the top of the main script).
3. Run the main script (e.g., `app.py` or `dog_breed.py`).
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to interact with the GUI.
